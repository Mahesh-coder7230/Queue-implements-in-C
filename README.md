# Queue-implements-in-C
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, meaning the element inserted first is the one to be removed first. It is similar to a line of people where the person who comes first is served first.  In C, a queue can be implemented using:  Arrays (Static Queue)  Linked Lists (Dynamic Queue)
